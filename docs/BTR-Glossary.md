# BTR Glossary

Terms specific to the BTR Framework.

---

## Core Pillars

### Boundary
Where scope stops regarding an action or branched idea. Boundaries shrink the problem space from infinite to finite.

### Term
A word or phrase used to describe a thing or express a concept. Can be domain-specific, made up by the user in context (e.g., "BTR"), or from general lexicon. The key: shared meaning understood by both AI and human in context.

### Relationship
A dependency. What must exist for something else to work. Sequence and pattern. Relationships force linearization—first-principles breakdown of what depends on what.

## Process Terms

### Entry Point
Where execution begins. The root dependency—the thing that must exist before anything else within scope. When you trace relationships backward from your End Goal, the Entry Point is where the chain terminates. It has no unresolved dependencies, is immediately actionable, and unlocks all downstream work.

### End Goal
The outcome you're trying to achieve. The anchor for all BTR discovery. Expressed as a user story ("As a [user], I want [action] so that [outcome]") or outcome statement ("The end state is [description]"). Everything works backward from this.

### Nudge
When the AI surfaces a dependency the user hasn't acknowledged. The AI sees patterns humans miss because their minds are scattered. A nudge says: *"You can't do X without Y—did you consider that?"* User decides if it matters.

### Parked
A known-unknown that's been acknowledged but deferred. Not ignored—just not in scope for this pass. Captured for later.

### Pillar Misalignment
When Boundaries, Terms, and Relationships aren't aligned at execution. The core failure mode. Results in friction, confusion, scope creep, wrong outputs.

### Readiness Assessment
A deliberate checkpoint before execution. Evaluates whether discovery is complete enough to proceed. Answers the question: *"Given what we know, do we believe we have enough to execute?"* Not a guarantee—a conscious decision point. Includes confidence level, rationale, and known risks.

## Knowledge States

### Unknown-Unknown
You don't know what you don't know. Chaos. BTR's job is to surface these.

### Known-Unknown
A question you know to ask. Progress. These can be answered or parked.

### Known-Known
An answer. Established fact. Your growing body of resolved BTR.

## Other Terms

### BTR Artifact
The written document produced by BTR discovery. Must contain at minimum: End Goal, Entry Point, Glossary of Terms, Mapped Relationships, Boundaries, Parked Items, and Readiness Assessment. Must be readable by both human and AI. This is the product—the thing that survives sessions, transfers between models, and can be shared. Without a written artifact, BTR didn't happen.

### Context Control
BTR's function as a context curation mechanism. Boundaries define what context matters. Terms ensure context is understood the same way. Relationships define how context connects. Without this, you're dumping noise into the AI. With it, you're providing signal—only what's needed for the goal.

### Context Permanence
Documented BTR survives token limits and transfers between AI models. When you hit the context window ceiling or switch to a different AI, normally you lose everything. But a BTR artifact can be pasted into a new session—any model, any time—and the AI is immediately caught up. Ideas persist beyond any single conversation.

### Cascading Complexity
Applying BTR at multiple levels of granularity—from project level down to task level. How deep you go depends on problem complexity and uncertainty tolerance.

### Premature Execution
Starting to build before BTR is sufficiently complete. Too many unknown-unknowns remain. Pillars misaligned. Common cause of project failure.
